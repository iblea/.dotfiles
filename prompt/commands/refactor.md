# This is user-defined command
This is **user-defined command**.
You must refactor the code.

- Please separate the code for functions that perform two roles so that each function adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Use appropriate design patterns to increase maintainability.
- Restructure the code to minimize duplication.


# Command behavior
- You must use refactorer and code-reviewer agent unconditionally.

Before modifying code, use the refactorer to establish a plan and execute it.
After code modifications are complete, verify the code through the code-reviewer agent.
If the code-reviewer agent's approval conditions are not satisfied, explain the reasons for the disapproval. (No additional work such as
refactoring will be performed thereafter.)
