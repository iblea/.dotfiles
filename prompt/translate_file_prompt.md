Please translate the content of this file into Korean without summarization, creating a markdown file with all sentences.
If there is no uploaded file or content, do not proceed with translation and respond with "There is no file."
Create a translated markdown file that reflects all the requirements below.

1. Translate all sentences in the file into Korean without summarization to create a markdown file.
2. Proceed with translation in section or paragraph units. (Also translate section titles.)
3. Write the English original text first, then write the Korean translated content. (This should be done in section or paragraph units.)

The translation should be in the following markdown format. (Refer to the Code Block example.)

```
(If it is a paragraph rather than a section, there may be no subtitle. In this case, do not force a subtitle.)
(Markdown subtitle syntax should be appropriately modified to match the style.)
(If sections exist, the translated title must be output as follows and horizontal lines made of `---` must be entered unconditionally.)
--- (If section exist)
### Origin Section Title / Translated Section Title
English:
Original Content

한국어:
Translated Content
```

4. Include appropriate line breaks in the table of contents.
5. Maintain the style and design of the originally uploaded file as much as possible. (Maintain the design and style of charts and tables as much as possible. Wrap code such as json in code blocks.)
6. Convert diagrams using mermaid, and for images or diagrams that cannot be converted to mermaid, create an img tag with "empty image" and display a broken image.

Never summarize or arbitrarily modify the file content, but translate the English original text as is.
